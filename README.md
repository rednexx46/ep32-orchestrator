# Orchestrator (MQTT to MongoDB)

This service listens to MQTT messages forwarded by the ESP32 gateway, which collects sensor data from nearby nodes over ESP-NOW and publishes it via MQTT. It stores the received sensor data in MongoDB. The orchestrator is written in Go and designed to run as a lightweight Docker container on a Raspberry Pi or similar edge gateway.

## üì¶ Features

* Subscribes to `mesh/data/#` MQTT topics
* Extracts device ID and payload
* Saves data to MongoDB with timestamp
* Fully configurable via environment variables
* Lightweight and production-ready

## üß™ Prerequisites

* Running MQTT broker (e.g. Mosquitto)
* MongoDB instance (can be local or in Docker)

## üöÄ Running with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Make sure your `docker-compose.yml` has all required environment variables and that your MQTT and MongoDB services are reachable.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go             # Main orchestrator logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile          # Docker build for Go binary
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml  # Docker runtime configuration

## üß± MongoDB Schema

Each document inserted has the following structure:

```json
{
  "device_id": "24a160e5a1fc",
  "payload": "T=24.5C H=45% P=1013hPa",
  "timestamp": "2024-05-16T16:35:00Z"
}
```

## üîí Security Notes

* Be sure to protect MongoDB with authentication.
* Use Docker secrets or .env for managing sensitive values.
* If using MQTT auth, match credentials with your broker config.
